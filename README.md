## Features
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate your heart disease risk based on clinical parameters.
- **Parameter Analysis**: Visualize key health parameters using radar charts and comparison tables.
- **Personalized Guidance**: Receive tailored recommendations based on your risk level.
- **AI Health Advisor**: Get AI-generated advice for improving heart health (optional feature).
- **Sample Profiles**: Quickly load predefined sample profiles for testing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but Recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Additional Resources** (If Applicable)
   - If the app uses external models or datasets, download them and place them in the appropriate directory as specified in the code.

## Configuration

### Hugging Face Login (Optional for AI Advisor)
To enable the AI Health Advisor feature, you need to configure your Hugging Face credentials:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:
   ```env
   HF_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   HF_PASS=your-huggingface-api-key
   ```
3. Ensure the `.env` file is not committed to version control by adding it to `.gitignore`.

---

## Running the App

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run GUI.py
   ```

2. Open the provided local URL in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Use the sidebar to load sample profiles or enter your own health parameters for risk assessment.

---

## Dependencies

The app relies on the following Python libraries:
- `streamlit`: For building the interactive web interface.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `hugchat`: For AI-driven health recommendations (optional).

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Known Issues

1. **Random Predictions**: The current implementation uses a fake prediction function (`fake_predict`) for demonstration purposes. Replace this with a real machine learning model for accurate predictions.
2. **Hugging Face Integration**: The AI Health Advisor feature requires a valid Hugging Face account and API key. If credentials are not configured, the feature will be disabled.
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure sensitive information (e.g., API keys) is stored securely in a `.env` file and excluded from version control.
